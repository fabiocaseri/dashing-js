Every new Dashing project comes with sample widgets & sample dashboards for you to explore. The directory is setup as follows:

* Assets — All your images, fonts, and js/coffeescript libraries. Uses <del>[Sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets)</del> [Mincer](http://nodeca.github.io/mincer/).
* Dashboards — One .jade file for each dashboard that contains the layout for the widgets.
* Jobs — Your js/coffee jobs for fetching data (e.g for calling third party APIs like twitter). Name them *\*.job.js/\*.job.coffee*
* Lib — Optional js/coffee files to help out your jobs.
* Public — Static files that you want to serve. A good place for a favicon or a custom 404 page.
* Widgets — All the html/css/coffee for individual widgets.

Run `dashing-js` from command line to find out what command line tools are available to you.

1. The version of Node is defined in package.json
2. The main script to run is server.js
3. The web server port is pulled from process.env.PORT
